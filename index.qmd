# Research Question

Climate change has been prevalent worldwide, causing adverse effects felt by all. It would be interesting to explore:

-   How has Brunei's temperature evolved over time, and is this consistent with global temperature trends?
-   Using PCA to interpret these trends?

# Data Collection and Preprocessing

Dataset is sourced from NASA POWER API accessed using nasapower package in R. Available data ranged from year 1981 to 2023. Code as follow:

```{r include=FALSE}
library(nasapower)
library(tidyverse)
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecast)
library(tsibble)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
```

```{r}
t2m <- get_power(
  community = "re",
  lonlat = c(114.9, 4.9),
  pars = "T2M",
  dates = c("1981-01-01", "2023-12-31"),
  temporal_api = "monthly"
)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
t2m <-
  t2m %>% 
    pivot_longer(
      cols = 5:16,
      names_to = "MONTH"
    ) %>% 
    select(-ANN, -LON, -LAT)

t2m$DATE <- ymd(paste(t2m$YEAR, t2m$MONTH, "01"))

# COnver MONTH to Month
t2m$MONTH <- str_to_title(t2m$MONTH)

# Convert MONTH to a factor with the correct order 
t2m$MONTH <- factor(t2m$MONTH, levels = month.abb)
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```{r}
viz <-
  ggplot(t2m, aes(x = DATE, y = value)) +
    geom_line(col = "blue") + 
    labs(
      title = "Brunei BSB Monthly Temperature",
      x = "Date",
      y = "Temperature (°C)"
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
ggplotly(viz)
```

Most of extreme temperature falls in the month of May. Does this mean mid year is the hottest in Brunei? Does these period of extreme temperature correlate with Elnino effect?

Applying linear regression, it is suggested that temperature increase by 0.018°C. Despite seeming negligible, this correspond to 0.9°C over 50 years!

```{r}
lm_temp <- lm(value ~ YEAR, data = t2m)
summary(lm_temp)
```
